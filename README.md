# Python Ping Pong Game

This is a simple two-player Ping Pong game developed in Python using the `turtle` graphics library.

## Features

* A ball that bounces off walls and paddles.

* Score tracking for both players.

### Game Rules

* The first player to reach a certain score (not implemented in this version, but can be added) wins.
